# Ducks

This project is an attempt to learn a few things:

 - Python module and project structure
 - Python classes, subclasses, inheritance, and abstract classes
 - General object oriented design, as shown in the book Head First Design Patterns

 I will use this README as a place to keep notes, along with comments on my code.

 **Questions**

Project organization: why can't I import 'ducks' and then access the classes within that file, without referencing them with ducks.<ClassName>? In other words, how do I get them "loose?" Perhaps from ducks import *?
